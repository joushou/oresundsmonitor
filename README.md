# oresundsmonitor

Ã–resundsbron travel and weather SMS notification services. The services are configured through a shell script file called "settings" stored beside the script. The expected variables are written at the top of the individual scripts.

To use, fill out a "settings" file beside the script you want to use, and set up a cronjob or similar to call the script at a fitting interval (5-10 minutes?).

## travelmonitor

Monitors bridge passes, and sends an SMS through Twilio when a pass is detected. User credentials for the monitored subscription is required in plaintext, so make sure you're using a random password.

## bridgemonitor

Monitors bridge status, and sends an SMS through Twilio when the status changes.

## bugs

* bridge- and travelmonitor just act upon the last entry in the polled data. If multiple passes are made in between polls, or multiple bridge status messages are present, only the last entry is used for notification purposes.
