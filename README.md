# oresundsmonitor

Ã–resundsbron travel and weather SMS notification services. The services are configured through a shell script file called "settings" stored beside the script. The expected variables are written at the top of the individual scripts.

To use, fill out a "settings" file beside the script you want to use, and set up a cronjob or similar to call the script at a fitting interval (5-10 minutes?).
